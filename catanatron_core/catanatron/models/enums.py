Main class to represent action. Should be immutable.

The "value" is a polymorphic field that acts as the "parameters"
for the "action_type". e.g. where to ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT
or who to steal from in a ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER action.

We use this class to represent both the _intent_ of say "moving a
robber to Tile (0,0,0) and stealing from Blue" as well as
the final result of such a move. In moves like these where the intent
is not enough to be used to reproduce the game identically,
we use "None"s in the "value" container as placeholders 
for that information needed for fully reproducing a game.
(e.g. card stolen, dev card bought, etc...)
