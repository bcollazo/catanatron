Main class to represent action. Should be immutable.

The "value" is a polymorphic field that acts as the "parameters"
for the "action_type". e.g. where to ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT
or who to steal from in a ActionType.MOVE_ROBBER action.

We use this class to represent both the _intent_ of say "moving a
robber to Tile (0,0,0) and stealing from Blue" as well as
the final result of such a move. In moves like these where the intent
is not enough to be used to reproduce the game identically,
we use `None`s in the "value" container as placeholders 
for that information needed for fully reproducing a game.
(e.g. card stolen, dev card bought, etc...)
