    Attributes:
        players (List[Player]): DEPRECATED. Reference to list of players.
            Use .colors instead, and move this reference to the Game class.
            Deprecated because we want this class to only contain state
            information that can be easily copiable.
        board (Board): Board state. Settlement locations, cities,
            roads, ect... See Board class.
        player_state (Dict[str, Any]): See PLAYER_INITIAL_STATE. It will
            contain one of each key in PLAYER_INITIAL_STATE but prefixed
            with "P<index_of_player>".
            Example: { P0_HAS_ROAD: False, P1_SETTLEMENTS_AVAILABLE: 18, ... }
        color_to_index (Dict[Color, int]): Color to seating location cache
        colors (Tuple[Color]): Represents seating order.
        resource_freqdeck (List[int]): Represents resource cards in the bank.
            Each element is the amount of [WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE].
        development_listdeck (List[FastDevCard]): Represents development cards in
            the bank. Already shuffled.
        buildings_by_color (Dict[Color, Dict[FastBuildingType, List]]): Cache of
            buildings. Can be used like: `buildings_by_color[Color.RED][SETTLEMENT]`
            to get a list of all node ids where RED has settlements.
        actions (List[Action]): Log of all actions taken. Fully-specified actions.
        num_turns (int): number of turns thus far
        current_player_index (int): index per colors array of player that should be
            making a decision now. Not necesarilly the same as current_turn_index
            because there are out-of-turn decisions like discarding.
        current_turn_index (int): index per colors array of player whose turn is it.
        current_prompt (ActionPrompt): DEPRECATED. Not needed; use is_initial_build_phase,
            is_moving_knight, etc... instead.
        is_discarding (bool): If current player needs to discard.
        is_moving_knight (bool): If current player needs to move robber.
        is_road_building (bool): If current player needs to build free roads per Road
            Building dev card.
        free_roads_available (int): Number of roads available left in Road Building
            phase.
